# 🍧 Sorbet

> A big meal is great.
> But after such a meal, you may need something light and refreshing as a palate cleanser.

_Sorbet_ is a small, readable, and extensible [finite element](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_element_method) tool for quickly testing ideas or for teaching purposes.
The key point here is **readability** and **extensibility** over performance!
